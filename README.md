# About

Object Rendering Language(ORL for short), is a simple 2d engine, that is regularly updated, in the future, i plan to make it able to scan directories for the .lng file, so you can have a named file of your choice(as long as it ends in .lng), for a example on how to use it, see [the example file](objects.lng)
it is writen in c++, and has its own custom "syntax", althought very <s>very, very</s> primitive
